    <h1>CSS Units</h1>
    <p id="heading-para">
      Many CSS properties like <b>width, margin, padding</b>, and
      <b>font-size</b> take a length, and CSS has many different ways to express
      length.CSS units can be of two types: absolute and relative. <br /><b
        >Absolute units</b
      >
      are normally considered of same size and are not relative to anything.
      <code> cm, mm, in, px</code> are some of commonly used absolute units.<br />
      <b>Relative units</b> on the other hand, are dependent on something else,
      generally, size of the element or parent element, they change to change
      their size based on other factor. <code>em, vh, vw, rem</code> are some
      commonly used relative units . Some of commonly used css units are:
    </p>
    <main>
      <!-- px -->
      <section class="px">
        <h2>1. px</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Pixels or simply <b>px</b> are one of the most common length units in
          CSS. In CSS, 1 pixel is formally defined as 1/96 of an inch.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.paragraph{<br />font-size : 16px <br />}</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p id="px-example">
          This example uses 16px of font size. This is the default font-size for
          most of the browsers
        </p>
      </section>
      <!-- em -->
      <section class="em">
        <h2>2. em</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          The CSS em unit gets its name from a typographical unit. In
          typography, the term em was originally a reference to the width of the
          capital M in the typeface and size being used. When used with the
          font-size property, em inherits the font-size from its parent element.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.paragraph{<br />font-size : 1.5em <br />}</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p id="em-parent">I am parent with 30px of font-size</p>
        <div class="parent">
          <p id="em-child">
            I am using font size of 1.5em. My font-size will depend on my parent
            and I am 1.5 times the size of my parent.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <!-- rem -->
      <section class="rem">
        <h2>3. rem</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          This is simply known as root em. This relative unit is not affected by
          the size or setting of a parent element, and is instead based on the
          root of the document. For websites, the root of the document is the
          html element. In most browsers, the default font size is 16, so the
          font-size of html elements is 16px. But if a user changes their
          browser's default font size, then the font-size of p will scale up or
          down accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.paragraph{<br />font-size : 1.5rem <br />}</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <div class="parent">
          <p id="rem-parent">I am parent with 30px of font-size</p>
          <p id="rem-child">
            I am using font size of 1.5rem. My font-size will depend on the size
            of root element and not my parent and I am 1.5 times the size of
            root element.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <!-- percentage -->
      <section class="percentage">
        <h2>4. percentage (%)</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Percentages, are relative to the parent's size. For example, if you
          set an element's font-size as a percentage, it will be a percentage of
          the font-size of the element's parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.paragraph{<br />font-size : 120% <br />}</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p id="percentage-parent">I am parent with 30px of font-size</p>
        <div class="parent">
          <p id="percentage-child">
            I am using font size of 120%. My font-size will depend on the size
            of my parent.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p id="root-percentage-child">
          I am also using font size of 120%. But, my font-size will depend on
          the size of root element.
        </p>
      </section>
      <!-- vw -->
      <section class="vw">
        <h2>4. vw</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          <b>vw</b>, also commonly known as view width, is relative to viewport
          width. 1vw is 1% of the width of the viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.container{<br />height : 100vw <br />}</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <div id="view-width">
          I am using 100vw. I will take up the full width available. So if you
          resize your browser to 690 pixels wide, then I will take up all 690
          pixels in width.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="vh">
        <h2>5. vh</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          <b>vh</b>, also commonly known as view height, is relative to viewport
          height. 1vh is 1% of the height of the viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>.container{<br />height : 100vh <br />}</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>

        <div id="view-height">
          I am using 100vh. I will take up the 100% of height available. So if
          the browser window is 900 pixels high, my height will be 900 pixels.
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="dvh">
        <h2>6. dvh</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          They were introduced, when mobile browsers started changing viewport
          height as user scrolls down or up to see more content. The
          traditional, vh , were not behaving correctly when view height was
          changing. The <b>dynamic view port height (dvh)</b>, are defined with
          respect to any viewport size, that are dynamically expanded or
          retracted. <br />
          Let's say you have a phone that has 100px of screen space. When you
          load up a page, the browser UI takes up 15px which leaves 85px left
          for your website's content. However, browser, when you scroll down the
          browser UI only takes up 10px, which leaves your website content with
          90px.

        <p>
          <code>.container{<br />height : 100dvh <br />}</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <div id="dynamic-view-height">
          I am using 100vh. I will take up exactly 100% of height available on
          any screen. See me on mobile device to feel difference
